#33.1 LAB: Formatted output: No parking sign

#Write a program that prints a formatted "No parking" sign as shown below. 
#Note the first line has two leading spaces. 
#For ALL labs, end with newline (unless otherwise stated).

#  NO PARKING
#2:00 - 6:00 a.m.

#Solution: This one is pretty obvious, just match formatting.

print('  NO PARKING')
print('2:00 - 6:00 a.m.')
