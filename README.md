# D335 WGU Python Lab Solutions Examples

This repository is a collection of solutions to the (ungraded) Zylabs activities for WGU's D335 Intro to Python course.

This repository is intended to be used by students who are having difficulty solving labs or want to see another possible solution to a lab.


## Usage

The recommended usage of this repository is to attempt the lab independently and to use this repository as a guide if you get stuck on something.

This can also be used to compare solutions, as there are multiple ways to solve these questions, some involving much less logic than others.  If you find a solution that is more efficient and readable, feel free to submit a pull request.
